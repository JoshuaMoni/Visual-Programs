# Visual-Programs
These are some of the visual programs that I have made.

The current Implementation is a bit buggy when using the main file. It can lead to crashes and the file doesnt close properly when trying to use the tkinter interface. 
It is possible to use each of the files by themselves.

Astar: 
This has not been added to the main as an option as at the moment I wanted to keep the shortest path algorithms and sorting algoirthms seperate.
To use it click somewhere on the screen to select a start an end node. You can delete them by right clicking them. Once you place the start and end node you are also able
to draw barricades between the two points.
